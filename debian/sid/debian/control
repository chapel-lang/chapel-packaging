Description: productive parallel computing
 Chapel is an emerging programming language designed for productive parallel
 computing at scale.
 .
 Chapel's design and implementation have been undertaken with portability in
 mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity
 clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which
 it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc.
 in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that installs a minimal version of the
 compiler and runtime.

 This package provides a minimal version of the Chapel compiler that does not
 include LLVM integration. It functions by generating C code and then
 running the system C compiler.
